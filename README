Cuneiform library

The heavy lifting is done in the perl libraries

CHUNKER::getcorpus creates a list of all the files by spidering the site and writes it to dataout4/fulllist/{P|Q}DATA.xml

doitall.pl can be run from the command line and will create that list and then use it to iterate over the files to fill up the data

doSome.pl is used by the website to create small stats files. It is assumed that doitall has been run so all the files have been created.
